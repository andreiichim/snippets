# Snippets

## Geometry

### Magnitude
Returns the lenght of the vector.

### Add
Returns the sum of two vectors.

### Sub
Returns the sum between a vector and the second vector reversed.

### Mul
Returns a vector with the same direction but lenght * scalar.

### Dot Product
Returns a scalar.
When two vectors are at right angles the dot product is 0.

### Cross Product
Returns a vector that is perpendicular to both vectors.
When two vectors point in the same direction the cross product is 0.

### Normalize
Returns a vector pointing in the same direction but of lenght 1.

### Distance
Returns the distance between two points.
